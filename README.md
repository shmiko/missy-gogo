Missy-Go is a simple search engine based on the web crawler developed in the [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com/) CS101 course. 

It is built with the [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/) web framework by Marcel Hellkamp and designed to run on Google App Engine. The web crawler script `udacity_crawler.py`, located in the directory `/crawler/`, uses [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), an HTML parsing library by Leonard Richardson.

This was only possible due to the work done by Connor Mendenhall and his awesome tutorial documenting the builing of his famous DaveDaveFind Search Engine.
